A small note regarding the bootloader (sun7i/boot0 and sun7i/boot1).
Both binaries include the script.bin file inside, so they need to be adjusted per device.

==== boot0

The sun7i/boot0 file is encrypted, with the original unencrypted file living in the mod-livesuit-image project.
Even though the source code for boot0 is available, we cannot compile it (requires a custom chinese one, not gcc).
mod-livesuit-image patches in the MOD Duo fex file into boot0, then encrypts it when generating the livesuit image.

The extraction of the encrypted boot0 file can be done with awimage, in https://github.com/Ithamar/awutils.
(build of some tools fail, but awimage should be ok with gcc4)
After dumping the contents of the livesuit image, the file 'BOOT    _BOOT0_0000000000' is the boot0 encrypted binary.

=== boot1

The sun7i/boot1 file is not encrypted, and we're able to modify and build it.
The source code lives at https://github.com/moddevices/allwinner-boot/
(note that by default the makefile does not patch-in the fex file, only when 'make all && make patch' is run)
The boot1 binary is created in ./workspace/egon/boot1_nand.bin

When modifying boot1 code, you must copy the generated fex-*unpatched* binary to <mod-livesuit-image>/resources/boot1_nand.fex.
Also, you must copy the generated fex-*patched* binary to <CT_NandBoot>/sun7i/boot1_nand.fex.
